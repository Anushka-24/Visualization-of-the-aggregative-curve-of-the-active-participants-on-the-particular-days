This is the original data set from the company where I am working. As I am working as a Data Analyst intern in an event management industry, most of the time I have to check which participants have been activated their profile till the event date. If the any of the participant did not activate their profile, I confirm my colleagues who are working with the event organisers so that they can send a notification to the participants to activate their profile. As this is the original data set so for security purpose of the company I can't upload the data. But I can tell that I have worked only with the participant id, registration date, registration time, invitation time, participant type, registration state columns.
